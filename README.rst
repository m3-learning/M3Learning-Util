# M3Learning-Util

Utility functions for the M3-Learning Research Group

## Installation

```bash
pip install m3learning-util
```

## Purpose

This package contains utility functions that are used by the M3-Learning Research Group. The functions are divided into the following categories:
* Machine learning utilities (ml) - functions that are used to prepreprocess data and conduct tst for machine learning models.
* Utility functions (util) - These are utility function for making coding easier and dealing with file IO.
* Visualization utilities (viz) - These are functions that are used to visualize data with less code.
